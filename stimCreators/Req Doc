First Request

As discussed we would like to control for individual area, overall
area and density in a similar way to the procedure described in the
Holloway & Ansari (2009) paper that I sent to you.

Here are some additional specifics.

1. Both numerosities in the single and double digit range should be used
2. There should be 4 ratios (smaller/larger numerosity) per condition.
Say 0.5, 0.66. 0.25, 0.7) - You do not have to choose these ratios
exactly. Play around with the number pairs a bit and see what you get.
But there should be 4 different ratios and two relatively small ones
and two relatively large ones.
3. So you will have 4 ratio in the single digit range and 4 ratios in
the double digit range
4. Then there should be 8 trials per ratio
5. So in total there will be 8*4 small number pairs and 8*4 larger
number pairs = 64 trials

Second Request

1. Bitmaps showing either 1,2,3,4,7,11 and 16 dots
2. Overall area should be controlled, but individual item size varies
randomly across displays
3. There should be a total of 12 bitmaps per number for a total of 84 bitmaps.

Could you help me with this one too?
Do you think it is feasible that you might have these two sets of
bitmaps ready for me before January 15th?
